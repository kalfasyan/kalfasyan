## Hi 👋

### Data Scientist and Researcher in Pattern Recognition 👨‍💻 

🧪🖥️ With a solid scientific background in computer science and machine learning,  
I've gained invaluable experience through diverse research and work roles. 

🧠🔍 As a PhD researcher at KU Leuven for 2 years, I conducted in-depth studies on deep  
Convolutional Neural Networks and their resemblance to the visual system before exiting the programme. 

🚀💻 Later, as a Data Scientist at Faktion in Antwerp, I honed my skills in industry practices such as  
end-to-end ML pipelines, AI model training, Docker containers, and Cloud components.  
Along the way, my team & I achieved recognition by winning a hackathon on Activity Recognition. 

🐞📈 Motivated to pursue applied research, I returned to KU Leuven to obtain my PhD in Bioscience Engineering.  
Currently, as a Post-doctoral researcher at MeBioS, I focus on building intelligent automated insect-monitoring  
systems using optical sensors and Machine Learning. 

🎓💼 In addition to my research responsibilities, I actively guide and supervise theses of doctoral and  
master's students, contributing to their growth and development in the field of Bioscience Engineering. 

🔧🌐 Looking ahead, I am eager to deepen my understanding of MLOps tools and techniques. My objective is to deploy  
trained models to the cloud or integrate them into field agricultural devices like insect traps or imaging setups.  
I have already developed a Streamlit app for insect classification and annotation, and a FastAPI server to facilitate  
connectivity with our deployed model and various partners. 

📊📈 Furthermore, I am actively immersing myself in Hyperspectral Imaging techniques to effectively handle complex  
multidimensional data, enabling me to undertake more ambitious projects in the future. 

By remaining at the forefront of technological advancements, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to the field  
of pattern recognition by developing . Let's collaborate to try and create remarkable solutions that make a difference!
