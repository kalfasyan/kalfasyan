## Hi 👋

### Data Scientist and Researcher in Pattern Recognition 👨‍💻 

With a solid scientific background in computer science and machine learning, I have gained invaluable experience through diverse research and work roles. 💼  

As a PhD researcher at KU Leuven for 2 years, I conducted in-depth studies on deep Convolutional Neural Networks and their resemblance to the visual system before exiting the program. 🧠  

Later, as a Data Scientist at Faktion in Antwerp, I honed my skills in industry practices such as end-to-end ML pipelines, AI model training, Docker containers, and Cloud components. Notably, my team and I won a hackathon on Activity Recognition, organized by Vinci Energies. 🚀  

Motivated to pursue applied research, I returned to KU Leuven to obtain my PhD in Bioscience Engineering. Currently, as a Post-doctoral researcher at MeBioS, I focus on building intelligent automated insect-monitoring systems using optical sensors and Machine Learning. 🐞  

In addition to my research responsibilities and having followed Coaching and Leadership training courses by KUL experts, I actively guide and supervise theses of doctoral and master's students, contributing to their growth and development in the field of Bioscience Engineering. 🎓  

Looking ahead, I am eager to deepen my understanding of MLOps tools and techniques. My objective is to deploy trained models to the cloud or integrate them into field agricultural devices like insect traps or imaging setups. I have already developed a Streamlit app for insect classification and annotation, and a FastAPI server to facilitate connectivity with our deployed model and various partners that use our imaging device (examples of device and software: [1](https://www.veed.io/view/5147995d-7dad-44e0-b3c7-fd91f16699f0?panel=showcase), [2](https://www.veed.io/view/8efbeae2-e421-456a-9b50-30c968bcdf3e?panel=showcase)). I am passionate about tinkering with edge devices (like Raspberry Pi) and Linux systems for many of the tasks I occupy myself with. It allows me to further expand my expertise and problem-solving capabilities. 🔧  

In addition, I am actively exploring Hyperspectral Imaging techniques to effectively manage complex multidimensional data, enabling me to undertake more ambitious projects in the future. 📊

By staying up-to-date with technological advancements, my commitment is to make meaningful contributions to the field of pattern recognition. Let's collaborate to create practical solutions that have a real impact! 🌟
