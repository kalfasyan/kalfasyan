## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **multidisciplinary computational scientist and software engineer** at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Bioscience Engineering, with **10+ years of combined experience** across academia, industry, and R&D environments.  

#### **💼 My professional journey** 
```
🧠 AI in Neurophysiology  →  🚀 Industry AI  →  🐞 Agricultural AI  →  🛰️ AI for Earth Observation
           Lab Research         Applied Solutions     Field Applications    Global Monitoring
```

#### **🌍 Currently Working On** 
I'm developing AI models for the **[Land Cover and Forest Monitoring (LCFM)](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/news/lcfm-a-new-chapter-in-global-land-cover-monitoring)** project at Vito, part of the EU's Copernicus programme, in the team that released the famous [ESA WorldCover products](https://esa-worldcover.org/en). My work involves building multi-stage AI pipelines that process satellite data to create global land cover maps at unprecedented 10m resolution—a tenfold improvement over previous products. I specialize in training cloud segmentation models for quality signal identification, maintaining our code repositories on github (soon to be open-sourced), and deploying classification models that generate annual land cover maps for the entire planet, directly supporting EU environmental policy and climate monitoring initiatives.
