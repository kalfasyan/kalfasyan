## üéØ About Me

I'm a **multidisciplinary computational scientist** at the intersection of AI, Machine Learning, and Bioscience Engineering, with **10+ years of combined experience** across academia, industry, and R&D environments.  
  
**üíº My professional journey**: My professional journey encompasses end-to-end ML pipeline development, cloud-based AI deployment, and strategic AI implementation in production environments, with a consistent focus on driving meaningful technological advancements that address real-world challenges.

```
**üåç Currently Working On**: I'm developing AI models for the **[Land Cover and Forest Monitoring (LCFM)](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/news/lcfm-a-new-chapter-in-global-land-cover-monitoring)** project at Vito, part of the EU's Copernicus programme, in the team that released the famous [ESA WorldCover products](https://esa-worldcover.org/en). My work involves building multi-stage AI pipelines that process satellite data to create global land cover maps at unprecedented 10m resolution‚Äîa tenfold improvement over previous products. I specialize in training cloud segmentation models for quality signal identification, maintaining our code repositories on github (soon to be open-sourced), and deploying classification models that generate annual land cover maps for the entire planet, directly supporting EU environmental policy and climate monitoring initiatives.
