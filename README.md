## Hi 👋  
First things first, some personal promo :)  
Check out my image tiling library [`plakakia`](https://github.com/kalfasyan/plakakia) and my latest [streamlit app](https://basic-image-processing.streamlit.app/) for image processing.  
  
### Bio - Data Scientist / Researcher / Machine Learning Engineer 👨‍💻  

With a solid scientific background in computer science and machine learning, I have gained invaluable experience through diverse research and industry roles. 💼  

#### 🎓 Studies 
I studied Computer Science in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece 🇬🇷) earning a solid basis around computing theory. Next, I finished my Master's in [Machine Learning at KTH University](https://www.kth.se/profile/ikalfas) (Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪) specializing in Computational Neuroscience (Spiking Neural Networks). For my [thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A868833&dswid=-157) work, I simulated a small piece of the neocortex using the [NEST simulator in Python](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to compare various [columnar structure types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_column) and their activity.  

#### 🧠 Deep Learning in Neurophysiology at KUL (PhD researcher)  
As a PhD researcher in the [lab of Neurophysiology of KU Leuven](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000666/50000669/50488669) for 2 years, I conducted in-depth studies on deep Convolutional Neural Networks and their resemblance to the visual system. My work ([[1]](https://www.eneuro.org/content/4/3/eneuro.0113-17.2017.abstract)[[2]](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006557)[[3]](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/33/6513.abstract)[[4]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00402/full)) included complex computer vision and regression tasks for predicting biological neuronal activity based on artificial neuron activations of various SOTA CNN models, leading to 4 scientific publications in renowned Neuroscience journals and a poster presentation at [VSS conference](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2651681) (Florida, USA), before exiting the programme.    

#### 🚀 Applied AI at Faktion (Data Scientist)  
Having developed a passion for [#Deep-Learning]() and its software ecosystem, I wanted to shift my focus from fundamental research to applied AI applications for which I could more clearly gauge their societal impact. Working as a Data Scientist at [Faktion](https://faktion.com/) in Antwerp, I honed my skills in industry practices such as end-to-end ML pipelines, AI model training, Docker containers, and Cloud components. Notably, my team and I won a hackathon on Activity Recognition in video data, organized by Vinci Energies.   

#### 🐞 Data-centric AI at MeBioS, KUL (PhD researcher)
Motivated to pursue more applied research this time, and be closer to home, I returned to Leuven (and KUL) to obtain my [#PhD]() in Bioscience Engineering. My thesis topic was [Optical Insect Identification using Artificial Intelligence](https://kuleuven.limo.libis.be/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=lirias3887120&context=SearchWebhook&vid=32KUL_KUL:Lirias&lang=en&search_scope=lirias_profile&adaptor=SearchWebhook&tab=LIRIAS&query=any%2Ccontains%2CLIRIAS3887120&offset=0) and focused on 2 distinct insect recognition tracks based on:  
1) images, using Computer Vision,
2) time-series (wingbeats), using Signal Processing.
  
The main objectives of my research were around data-centric AI and strict model validation to reveal the "true" model performance once deployed in the field. During my PhD I have developed software tools, GUIs ([#Streamlit](), [#Tkinter]()) and AI models which ran on [#IoT]() (e.g., RaspberryPi) devices, Linux/Windows desktops, and the cloud ([#AWS]()). My latest achievement is a Streamlit & [#FastAPI]() server that runs on AWS and serves our image classification model to external companies and collaborating research institutes (examples of device and software: [1](https://www.veed.io/view/5147995d-7dad-44e0-b3c7-fd91f16699f0?panel=showcase), [2](https://www.veed.io/view/8efbeae2-e421-456a-9b50-30c968bcdf3e?panel=showcase)). Apart from the API, it incorporates a user-friendly GUI to aid researchers with image annotation tasks.  
  
#### 🦾 Postdoctoral Researcher at MeBioS, KUL
Currently, as a Postdoctoral researcher at MeBioS (KUL), I am involved in multiple projects around AI in insect monitoring or agrifood applications. I guide PhD researchers and build software tools that will aid in their research. Being more involved in Hyperspectral Imaging ([#HSI]()) projects, I familiarized myself with SOTA techniques to deal with complex hypercube data using AI. Moreover, I am the Research Data Manager for our lab, being responsible on hosting and sharing our data using KUL's infrastructure, and I'm maintaining our research group's [#GitLab]() (here's [its public profile](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/mebios-dl), where you can see some of its content).  
  
#### 🌟 Future
Looking ahead, I am eager to deepen my understanding of MLOps tools and techniques. My objective is to deploy more trained models to the cloud or integrate them into field agricultural devices like insect traps or imaging setups. I have already developed a Streamlit app for insect classification and annotation, and a FastAPI server to facilitate connectivity with our deployed model and various partners that use our imaging device . I am passionate about tinkering with edge devices (like Raspberry Pi) and Linux systems for many of the tasks I occupy myself with. It allows me to further expand my expertise and problem-solving capabilities.  

In addition, I am actively exploring Hyperspectral Imaging techniques to effectively manage complex multidimensional data, enabling me to undertake more ambitious projects in the future. 📊

By staying up-to-date with technological advancements, my commitment is to make meaningful contributions to the field of pattern recognition. Let's collaborate to create practical solutions that have a real impact!  🔧
