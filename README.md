### Background
  
### üéì Studies 
Keywords: *Python Programming, Artificial Neural Networks, Spiking Neural Networks, Machine Learning*  
  
I studied Computer Science in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece üá¨üá∑) earning a solid basis around computing theory. Next, I finished my Master's in [Machine Learning at KTH University](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machine-learning) (Stockholm, Sweden üá∏üá™) specializing in Computational Neuroscience (Spiking Neural Networks). For my [thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A868833&dswid=-157) work, I simulated a small piece of the neocortex using the [NEST simulator in Python](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to compare various [columnar structure types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_column) and their activity. My academic journey continued with two years of research in a neurophysiology lab, exploring computational neuroscience. While I did not complete the initial PhD program, I subsequently earned a PhD in Bioscience Engineering, pivoting my research to focus on optical insect identification using artificial intelligence.  

### :briefcase: Professional Experience  
  
#### Deep Learning in Neurophysiology at KUL (PhD researcher) üß†  
Keywords: *Brain-Inspired AI, Visual System Research, Neural Activity Prediction, Computer Vision, Scientific Publishing*  
  
As a PhD researcher in the [lab of Neurophysiology of KU Leuven](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000666/50000669/50488669) for 2 years, I conducted in-depth studies on deep Convolutional Neural Networks and their resemblance to the visual system. My work included complex computer vision and regression tasks for predicting biological neuronal activity based on artificial neuron activations of various SOTA CNN models, leading to 4 scientific publications in renowned Neuroscience journals ([[1]](https://www.eneuro.org/content/4/3/eneuro.0113-17.2017.abstract)[[2]](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006557)[[3]](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/33/6513.abstract)[[4]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00402/full)) and a poster presentation at [VSS conference](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2651681) (Florida, USA), before exiting the programme.     
#### Applied AI at Faktion (Data Scientist) üöÄ  
Keywords: *Practical Industry AI Solutions, Machine Learning Pipelines, Computer Vision, Cloud Technology, Hackathons*  
  
Having developed a passion for Deep Learning and its software ecosystem, I wanted to shift my focus from fundamental research to applied AI applications for which I could more clearly gauge their societal impact. Working as a Data Scientist at [Faktion](https://faktion.com/) in Antwerp, I honed my skills in industry practices such as end-to-end ML pipelines, AI model training, Docker containers, and Cloud components. Notably, my team and I won a [hackathon on Activity Recognition in video data](https://faktion.com/blog/human-activity-capturer-and-klassifier-wins-first-prize-at-vinci-energies-hackaton/), organized by Vinci Energies.   

#### Data-centric AI at MeBioS, KUL (PhD researcher) üêû  
Keywords: *Insect Recognition, Optical Sensors, Smart Monitoring Systems, Computer Vision, Sound Pattern Analysis, EU Projects, IoT Devices, Cloud Services*  
  
Motivated to pursue more applied research this time, and be closer to home, I returned to Leuven (and KUL) to obtain my PhD in Bioscience Engineering. My thesis topic was [Optical Insect Identification using Artificial Intelligence](https://kuleuven.limo.libis.be/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=lirias3887120&context=SearchWebhook&vid=32KUL_KUL:Lirias&lang=en&search_scope=lirias_profile&adaptor=SearchWebhook&tab=LIRIAS&query=any%2Ccontains%2CLIRIAS3887120&offset=0) and focused on 2 distinct insect recognition tracks based on:  
1) images, using Computer Vision, (example [repo1](https://github.com/kalfasyan/photobox), [repo2](https://github.com/kalfasyan/photobox_app), [repo3](https://github.com/kalfasyan/stickybugs-ai))  
2) time-series (wingbeats), using Signal Processing. (example [repo1](https://github.com/kalfasyan/wbai), [repo2](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/mebios-dl/research/3e200920/flying_insect_trap))  
  
The main objectives of my research were around data-centric AI and strict model validation to reveal the "true" model performance once deployed in the field. During my PhD I have developed software tools, GUIs (Streamlit, Tkinter) and AI models (YOLO, RCNN, 2-stage detectors, etc.) which ran on IoT (e.g., RaspberryPi) devices, Linux/Windows desktops, and the cloud (AWS). One of my proudest achievements was a custom API server that still runs on AWS and serves image classification models to an external company and several collaborating research institutes (examples of device and software: [1](https://www.veed.io/view/5147995d-7dad-44e0-b3c7-fd91f16699f0?panel=showcase), [2](https://www.veed.io/view/8efbeae2-e421-456a-9b50-30c968bcdf3e?panel=showcase)). Apart from the API (FastAPI), it incorporated a user-friendly GUI (Streamlit) to aid researchers with image annotation tasks.  
  
#### Postdoctoral Researcher at MeBioS, KUL ü¶æ  
Keywords: *Research Mentorship, Advanced Imaging, Agricultural Technologies, Software Development, Data Management*  
  
As a Postdoctoral researcher at MeBioS (KUL), I got involved in multiple projects around AI in insect monitoring or agrifood applications. I guided PhD researchers and built software tools that aided in their research. Being more involved in Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) projects, I familiarized myself with SOTA techniques to deal with complex hypercube data using AI. Moreover, I was the research data and software manager for our lab, being responsible on hosting and sharing our software/data using KUL's infrastructure and maintaining our research group's GitLab (here's [its public profile](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/mebios-dl), where you can see some of its content). Last but not least, I developed an image tiling library [`plakakia`](https://github.com/kalfasyan/plakakia) which helped researchers with image processing and object detection tasks.  
  
#### Remote Sensing & AI Researcher at Vito üõ∞Ô∏è  
Keywords: *Earth Observation, Environmental Monitoring, EU Projects, Sustainable Development, Geospatial Analysis, Cloud Services, Hadoop, Spark, AWS*  
  
Now, I'm taking my expertise to new heights as a remote sensing & AI researcher at Vito. My current role involves classifying the earth's land cover in a reliable and accurate way through the [LCFM project of the EU commission (JRC)](https://remotesensing.vito.be/services/copernicus-lcfm), which continues the very successful work done for the [ESA Worldcover products](https://esa-worldcover.org/en). This important work has real-world applications for environmental conservation, land use planning, and climate change mitigation. In this role, I leverage hyperspectral satellite data, computer vision techniques, and machine learning models to analyze and interpret complex environmental data. By integrating these advanced technologies, I contribute to the development of innovative solutions for monitoring and managing our planet's resources more effectively.
