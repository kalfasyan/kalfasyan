## Hi ðŸ‘‹
### Some things about me

ðŸ”­ Having equipped myself with a broad scientific background on computer science and machine learning, I worked for 2 years as a PhD researcher at Group Neurophysiology of KU Leuven, carrying out research on deep Convolutional Neural Networks and their similarities with the visual system.

ðŸ’» Next, I worked as a Data Scientist for approximately a year in a small - at that time - startup called Faktion in Antwerp. There I became familiar with various Industry practices and applications including: setting up end-to-end ML pipelines, training models for AI tasks, creating deployable Docker containers, setting up Cloud components and participating in 2 hackathons, winning one of them.

ðŸª° Currently, I am back to working as a PhD Researcher at MeBioS, KU Leuven. In this department I am using Machine Learning to build smart automated insect-monitoring systems that require high real-world performance using data captured by optical sensors. I contribute to multiple stages of each project, from data gathering and annotation to data analysis and model building. Having already finished my PhD requirements, I am expected to graduate on October 2022 ðŸŽ“

ðŸ”­ The next step is to do research for another year as a postdoctoral researcher in the same department. I want to learn more about MLOps tools and methods while I do research with Hyperspectral data (multi-dimensional).

### Contact

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always interested to learn about how Artificial Intelligence can improve the lives of the many (not the few ðŸ˜‰)
